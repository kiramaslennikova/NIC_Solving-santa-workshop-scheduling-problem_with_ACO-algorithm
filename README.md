# Solving Santa's Workshop Scheduling Optimization Problem by Ant Colony Optimization algorithm

This project aims to solve a scheduling optimization problem using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. 
The goal is to assign families to specific days while minimizing penalties based on preferences and constraints, using the Santa Workshop Tour 2019 Kaggle dataset.
# Methods description: 
The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm will be implemented to solve the problem. The algorithm will be implemented in Python and compared to 
baseline methods (e.g., random and greedy approaches) to evaluate its effectiveness in minimizing penalties.
